## Introduction
Coding, is <u>NOT</u> elegant. Get used to it. Almost everything I have ever programmed for one of our robots was made not because it was pretty and efficient, but because it worked. This documentation is here so you understand how and why it works. 
 
## Setting Up
This documentation assumes that you have already set up your phones according to the FTC Tutorial[^1] and that a robot has already been built.[^2]

If you have a robot and you phones are ready to go, great! Lets start with the software.
